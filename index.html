<h2>CIP status terms</h2>
<ul>
  <li><kbd class="tag draft">Draft</kbd> - a CIP that is open for consideration.</li>
  <li><kbd class="tag accepted">Accepted</kbd> - a CIP that is planned for immediate adoption, i.e. expected to be included in the next hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer CIPs).</li>
  <li><kbd class="tag final">Final</kbd> - a CIP that has been adopted in a previous hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer CIPs).</li>
  <li><kbd class="tag deferred">Deferred</kbd> a CIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption. May be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent hard fork.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CIP Types</h2>
<p>CIPs are separated into a number of types, and each has its own list of CIPs.</p>

<h3>Standard Track <span class="tag">Σ{{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|size}}</span></h3>
<p>Describes any change that affects most or all Core implementations, such as a change to the the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Core. Furthermore Standard CIPs can be broken down into the following categories.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"core"|relative_url}}">Core</a> <span class="tag">Σ{{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Core"|size}}</span></h4>
<p>Improvements requiring a consensus fork, as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to “core dev” discussions.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"networking"|relative_url}}">Networking</a> <span class="tag">Σ{{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Networking"|size}}</span></h4>
<p>Includes improvements around devp2p, network protocol specifications of whisper and swarm.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"interface"|relative_url}}">Interface</a> <span class="tag">Σ{{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Interface"|size}}</span></h4>
<p>Includes improvements around client API/RPC specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like method names and contract ABIs. The label “interface” aligns with the interfaces repo and discussion should primarily occur in that repository before a CIP is submitted to the CIPs repository.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"crc"|relative_url}}">CRC</a> <span class="tag">Σ{{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","CRC"|size}}</span></h4>
<p>Application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards, name registries, URI schemes, library/package formats and wallet formats.</p>

<h3><a href="{{"informational"|relative_url}}">Informational</a> <span class="tag">Σ{{site.pages|where:"type","Informational"|size}}</span></h3>
<p>Describes a Core design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Core community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational CIPs do not necessarily represent Core community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational CIPs or follow their advice.</p>

<h3><a href="{{"meta"|relative_url}}">Meta</a> <span class="tag">Σ{{site.pages|where:"type","Meta"|size}}</span></h3>
<p>Describes a process surrounding Core or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process CIPs are like Standards Track CIPs but apply to areas other than the Core protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Core's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational CIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Core development. Any meta-CIP is also considered a Process CIP.</p>
