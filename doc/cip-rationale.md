## CIP Rationale

We intend CIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Core. Because the CIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

For Core implementers, CIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally each implementation maintainer would list the CIPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.
