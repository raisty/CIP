## CIP Editors

### The current CIP editors are:

<ul>
{% for editor in site.data.editors %}
<li><b>{{ editor.name | escape }}</b>{% if editor.github %}{{ editor.github | prepend: ' (@' | append: ')' }}{% endif %}{% if editor.email %}{{ editor.email | prepend: ' <' | append: '>' }}{% endif %}{% if editor.key %}{{ editor.key | prepend: ' üóù' }}{% endif %}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

## CIP Editor Responsibilities

For each new CIP that comes in, an editor does the following:

- Read the CIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to get to final status.
- The title should accurately describe the content.
- Check the CIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (Github flavored Markdown), code style

If the CIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the CIP is ready for the repository, the CIP editor will:

- Assign an CIP number (generally the PR number or, if preferred by the author, the Issue # if there was discussion in the Issues section of this repository about this CIP)

- Merge the corresponding pull request

- Send a message back to the CIP author with the next step.

Many CIPs are written and maintained by developers with write access to the Core codebase. The CIP editors monitor CIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

The editors don't pass judgment on CIPs. We merely do the administrative & editorial part.
